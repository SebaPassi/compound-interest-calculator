## Introduction

The Compound Interest Calculator is a Python project that allows people to calculate the final amount of money accumulated after a certain period, including regular monthly contributions to an initial deposit.

## Why?

The high inflation present nowadays affects the value of our money, so it is important to try to overcome that devaluation and hopefully make a profit while doing it. After speaking with a lot of friends, I realized that most of them don't invest. In fact, many of them keep their savings "static" in their bank accounts.

With this program my objetive is to demonstrate the power of compound interest in growing people's money. It is a simple and effective way to increase wealth while mitigating the effects of inflation.

## What did I learn?

For the eleboration of this project I applied the basic concepts of frontend and backend. Through this process, I understood the importance of having an organized code. In addition, I focused on proper modularization of the code to achieve high cohesion and low coupling. This approach facilitated maintenance and scalability, allowing easier updates and the addition of new features in the future.
